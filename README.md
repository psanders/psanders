I'm a telematics engineer passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to improve people's lives, and build community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Docker, Kubernetes, NodeJS, and Redis. My interest in the VoIP and telephony led me to develop Astive Toolkit, Routr, and Project Fonos. I'm currently working on a telephony stack to help companies leave costly CPaaS/UCaaS.

I'm a telematics engineer passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to improve people's lives, and building community. 

I enjoy working with technologies like Voice AI, Docker, Kubernetes, NodeJS, and Redis. 

My interest in VoIP and telephony led me to develop Astive Toolkit, Routr, and Fonoster. 

I'm working on a telephony stack to help companies leave costly CPaaS/UCaaS.
